# Windows Server on a Contabo VPS - Installation Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing Windows 10 on a Contabo VPS. Please be aware that you assume full responsibility for all risks associated with this installation.

## Prerequisites

- VNC Viewer application installed. Download it from [here](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/).
- A Contabo VPS
- Microsoft Remote Desktop for RDP connection to the machine.

## Steps for installation

### 1. Prepare the VPS for installation

- Purchase a new Ubuntu VPS
- Log in to the Contabo user panel and navigate to the "Your services" section.
- On your VPS click the "Manage" button and select "Rescue System".
- Choose "Debian 10 - Live" from the "Rescue System Version" dropdown menu.
- Set a password and start the Rescue System.
- From the control panel go to "VPS control".
- Click the "Manage" button and select "VNC password".
- Set the VNC password. It must be 8 characters long, containing at least one uppercase and one lowercase character, and one number. Avoid using any special characters.
  
### 2. Connect to the VPS via SSH

- Open Terminal on MacOS or PuTTY on Windows.
- Log in with the command `ssh root@<MACHINE-IP>` and enter your Rescue System password.
- Execute the following commands:
  - `apt install git -y`
  - `git clone https://github.com/subhiashraf912/Windows-Server-Contabo-VPS.git`
  - `cd Windows-Server-Contabo-VPS`
  - `chmod +x windows-install.sh`
  - `./windows-install.sh`
  - The process takes approximately 15 minutes and completes when the ssh session disconnects due to the machine rebooting.
